Hello fello seniors! I am from Lucknow,UP. My hobbies include playing cricket
and watching cricket. I have very enthusiastic since the beginning of the 
academic year and I plan to join as many clubs I feel I can manage. Currently,
I am a part of Cricket club,Xpressions and aeromodelling club and looking 
forward to join the coding club!

I am hoping to learn new skills and showcase my passion for programming and 
exploring new technologies.

I want to contribute to the open source as it is a great learning opportunity
to get used to the advantages of github and this can be useful in the future as well
